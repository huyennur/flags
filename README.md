# flags
This is a repository of drawing flags of some countries all over the world using OPENGL with C++

To run all those file, you need to install OPENGL and GLUT.
In my case, i use Xcode so you don't need to install anything from the Internet because it has these stuffs in XCode.

You open "Frameworks and Libararies", and then hit "+" to add GLUT.framework and OpenGL.framework.
When you are done, you can run all those file.
